# d3-slippy

This is just experimental at this point. The goal is to minimize the interface with tile services and tile coordinates, allowing use of geographic coordiantes only.

A demonstration of this experiment can be found [here](https://bl.ocks.org/Andrew-Reid/a956ff105e12915e71617ff0e469664e).

I won't be writing any documentation or explanatory notes until I'm more confident in the final form the module would take.
